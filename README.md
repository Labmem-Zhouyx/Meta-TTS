<!--This repository is the official implementation of [Meta-TTS: Meta-Learning for Few-shot SpeakerAdaptive Text-to-Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). -->

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

This is how I build my environment, which is not exactly needed to be the same:
- [Optional] Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git) for Python version
  control, change to Python 3.8.6.
```bash
# After download and install pyenv:
pyenv install 3.8.6
pyenv local 3.8.6
```
- [Optional] Install [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git) as a plugin of pyenv for clean virtual environment.
```bash
# After install pyenv-virtualenv
pyenv virtualenv meta-tts
pyenv activate meta-tts
```
- Install [learn2learn](https://github.com/learnables/learn2learn.git) from source.
```bash
# Install Cython first:
pip install cython

# Then install learn2learn from source:
git clone https://github.com/learnables/learn2learn.git
cd learn2learn
pip install -e .
```
- Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Proprocessing
First, download [LibriTTS](https://www.openslr.org/60/) and [VCTK](https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3443), then change the paths in `config/LibriTTS/preprocess.yaml` and `config/VCTK/preprocess.yaml`, then run
```bash
python3 prepare_align.py config/LibriTTS/preprocess.yaml
python3 prepare_align.py config/VCTK/preprocess.yaml
```
for some preparations.

Alignments of LibriTTS is provided [here](https://github.com/kan-bayashi/LibriTTSLabel.git), and
the alignments of VCTK is provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ScLIiyIgLRIZ03DqCmrZ8F75miC77o8g/view?usp=sharing).
You have to unzip the files into `preprocessed_data/LibriTTS/TextGrid/` and
`preprocessed_data/VCTK/TextGrid/`.

Then run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python3 preprocess.py config/LibriTTS/preprocess.yaml

# Copy stats from LibriTTS to VCTK to keep pitch/energy normalization the same shift and bias.
cp preprocessed_data/LibriTTS/stats.json preprocessed_data/VCTK/

python3 preprocess.py config/VCTK/preprocess.yaml
```

## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
